# MovieApp
A MovieApp made by using UIKit, CollectionViewCompositionalLayout, MovieDB API. You can see the now playing movies at the top and the movies of selected categories at the bottom. You can select category by tapping on the filter button at top right corner. When you select a movie it takes you to the detail page where you can see the release date, language and owerview of the movie and also the cast. I used alamofire to get data back from api and SDWebImage to get images.



In order to use the app you should enter your apikey in the NetworkHelper file and install pods including:
- Alamofire
- SDWebImage
- PanModal
